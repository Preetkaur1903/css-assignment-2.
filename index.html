    <div class="lyrics">
      <p>You should take it as a compliment</p>
      <p>That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk</p>
      <p>You should think about the consequence</p>
      <p>Of your magnetic field being a little too strong</p>
      <p>And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us</p>
      <p>He's in the club doing, I don't know what</p>
      <p>You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much</p>
      <p>Whiskey on ice, sunset and vine</p>
      <p>You've ruined my life by not being mine</p>
      <p>You're so gorgeous</p>
      <p>I can't say anything to your face</p>
      <p>â€˜Cause look at your face</p>
      <p>And I'm so furious</p>
      <p>At you for making me feel this way</p>
      <p>But what can I say?</p>
